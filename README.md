# 2d_dqn_treasurehunt
This is the 2d treasure hunt game

To run, type python treasurehunt.py 
This will create the environment with S as Start, G as Goal and W as wall.
You can change the MAX_EPISODES to the desired number to train your DQN.

I would likely to get some upgrade to my code to make it better!
